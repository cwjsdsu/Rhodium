WHAT'S NEW IN RHODIUM VERSION...
1.0.0 Oct 2025
* Draft of manual finished
* Prepared for public release

0.9.0 July 2024
* Finished implementing and testing various density options
* Started manual (unfinished)

0.8.9 May 2024
* Density output now .dres
* Fixed to work for charge of parity
* Can apply a superposition of particles addition/removal 
  (+ optional normalization of subsequent wavefunction)
* Added options for J+ raising operator, constructing only 'missing' densities

0.8.8 July 2023


0.8.7 June 2022

0.8.6 May 2022
 * Added OpenMP search (file/subroutine rhbasemap.f90/searcher) to speed up hop/jump creation  
 * Slight changes to output format (e.g., adding valence Z,N to .res file)
 * Finished so isospin densities can be printed out (non-charge-changing)
 * Validated charge-changing densities against BIGSTICK, including truncated spaces
 * Validated apply non-charge-changing one-body operator, including changes in parity, Jz

0.8.5  Apr 2022 
 * merged mpi projection routines (RZ)
 * merged lincom, linear combination of wfn routines (RZ)
 * added (and mostly validated) charge-changing densities

0.8.4 Dec 2021 - Mar 2022
 * Fixed output for density matrices
 * Added openmp to computing 1-body densities 

0.8.3 Sept 2021 - Dec 2021

0.8.2 June 2021 - Sept 2021
 * Spectroscopic factors work and sum rules tested
 * Apply one-body operators installed; still need to test for nontrivial change of M (and possible parity)

0.8.0  Feb 2020 -   
 * Reorganized construction of 1-body jumps to prepare for more general cases, 
specifically one-body hops (creation/destruction, needed for spectroscopic factors).

0.7.0  Feb 2020:
 * One-body densities from prior .wfn files from BIGSTICK. Can compute with different
values of M (Jz) and/or different parities. Works with truncated spaces. Must have
same number of protons and neutrons, and not yet fully working with holes.
